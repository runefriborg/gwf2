This test makes gwf go crazy for some reason. The proper files are not
by Source, so a lot of transfers fail. Since the task succeeds, but the post-
processing (moving the files) fails, gwf never closes the log file for Source.
This makes it even harder to see what goes wrong.

@shell in_file_names seq 0 10 | sed -e "s/^/f/" | tr "\n" " "
@shell out_file_names seq 0 10 | sed -e "s/^/other.f/" | tr "\n" " "

@target Source
:input hej
:output @in_file_names

for n in {0..10}; do echo $n; done

@template Reduce x
:input {x}
:output other.{x}

cat {x} > other.{x}

@template-target Reduce-{x} Reduce x=@in_file_names

@target Sink
:input @out_file_names
:output final

cat other.* > final
